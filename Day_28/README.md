# st_shap <br><br/>

[st_shap](https://github.com/snehankekre/streamlit-shap) is a Streamlit component that provides a wrapper to display [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) plots in Streamlit apps. <br/>


To be able to use SHAP wiithin stramlit you have to install the streamlit-shap library:<br/>
`pip install streamlit-shap`

There are also other prerequisite libraries to install (e.g. `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn` and `xgboost`), check the documentaion out for more information.

### What we are building?
