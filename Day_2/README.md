# Building 'Hello World' Streamlit app <br><br/>

Let's build a simple 'Hello World' app in Streamlit!

### Fire up your IDE
I used PyCharm since Atom has recently sunsetted to create a file called streamlit_app.py.
<br><br/>

### Enter code
Enter the following code to our file:

`import streamlit as st`

`st.write('Hello World!')`

After you add code, make sure you save the file.
<br><br/>

### Run app
To run an app, open terminal and run the following code:

`streamlit run streamlit_app.py`

<p align="center">
<img width="650em" src="" align = "center"/>
</p>

<br><br/>

### Hello World app
After running **streamlit run streamlit_app.py** command, we launch our app:

<p align="center">
<img width="650em" src="" align = "center"/>
</p>
