### Motivation

Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib and many more.

Why am I undertaking this challenge? I like possiblities streamlit offers such as interactivity and connection with non-technical user via web app. I would like to achieve moving from streamlit enthusiast to streamlit advanced user. Creative part of streamlit is also quite fun ðŸ˜‰

I'm also hoping to take my acquired knowledge into practice within my work. <br><br/>
