### Motivation

Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib and many more.

Why am I undertaking this challenge? I like possiblities streamlit offers such as interactivity and connection with non-technical user via web app. I would like to achieve moving from streamlit enthusiast to streamlit advanced user. Creative part of streamlit is also quite fun ðŸ˜‰

I'm also hoping to take my acquired knowledge into practice within my work. <br><br/>   

### About the Challenge

Everything about the challenge can be found on dedicated [streamlit website](https://blog.streamlit.io/30-days-of-streamlit/). <br> <br/>   

### Content

As the name gives away this is 30 tasks over (not necessary consecutive) 30 days.

ðŸ“† Days 1-7 cover beginner tasks such as setting up a local and cloud coding environment, installing the Streamlit library, and building first Streamlit Hello World app.

ðŸ“† Days 8-23 cover more intermediate topics. Each day may highlight a Streamlit command to use for creating and deploying a simple Streamlit app (e.g., build a simple app that uses the st.download_button command).

ðŸ“† Days 24-30 enter more advanced subjects. Learn about session states and things like efficient data and memory handling for Streamlit apps.
