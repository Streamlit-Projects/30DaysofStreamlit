# st.form <br><br/>

[st.form()](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/control-flow/st.form) command creates a form. The form is a container that visually groups other elements and widgets together, and contains a submit button.

When the form's submit button is pressed, all widget values inside the form will be sent to Streamlit in a batch. <br/>

### What we are building?
In this challenge we will built an app that demonstrates use of `st.form()` command with `st.form_submit_button()`.
<br/>
