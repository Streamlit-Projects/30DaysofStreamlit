# Streamlit Components <br><br/>


Components are third-party modules that extend what's possible with Streamlit. They couldn't be simpler to use, just a pip-install away. 
The best thing is that if you wish you can even create your own components. Documentation can be found below:

- [Create Components](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/components/create)
- [Publish Components](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/components/publish)
- [Components API](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/components/components-api)

Here you can view [app code](https://github.com/mBohunickaCharles/30DaysofStreamlit/blob/master/Day_14/components_app.py).
